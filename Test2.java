/**
 * This file contains a minimal example of a Linear "OpMode". An OpMode is a 'program' that runs
 * in either the autonomous or the TeleOp period of an FTC match. The names of OpModes appear on
 * the menu of the FTC Driver Station. When an selection is made from the menu, the corresponding
 * OpMode class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * Remove the @Disabled annotation on the next line or two (if present) to add this OpMode to the
 * Driver Station OpMode list, or add a @Disabled annotation to prevent this OpMode from being
 * added to the Driver Station.
